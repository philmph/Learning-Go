# Learning-Go

I will use this repository to upload example code while learning Go. Learning Go is purely driven out of personal interest.

As of 03.06.2024 I will be following along with [this amazing YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDQAZEJK8lI&list=PLoILbKo9rG3skRCj37Kn5Zj803hhiuRK6) and create code here accordingly.

Thank you Matt!
